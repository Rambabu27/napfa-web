<p>NAPFA has long been an advocate of Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion (DEI). The initiative was launched in 2018 with a mission to create a more inclusive membership by becoming a beacon for diversity within the financial planning profession by building and strengthening relationships between financial planning professionals and the diverse populations they serve.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since that time, the Initiative has sponsored scholarships to conferences, helped to defray the costs of CFP® exams and review materials, curated content for virtual learning and in-person educational events, and had tough conversations with NAPFA members around diversity, equity, inclusion, and racial inequality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most recently, the Initiative has compiled a Diversity + Inclusion Toolkit, a resource meant to help NAPFA members and their firms make meaningful change in the DEI space. While conversations and education around DEI is a crucial step to improving understanding, it's clear that without action, true progress cannot be achieved. This toolkit has both a written guide and a series of videos designed to help NAPFA members take action and access resources.</p>

<p>The toolkit addresses four key components of D, E, and I to help you:</p>
